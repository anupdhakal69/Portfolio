          <p className='text-gray-700 text-lg text-justify font-medium'> Hey, I'm Anup Dhakal. My love for coding began when I discovered how much fun it is to build things from scratch. Currently studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Applications, Iâ€™ve already worked on exciting projects. I thrive on challenges, especially when it comes to learning new tech like React and Node.js. </p>

          <p className='text-gray-700 text-lg text-justify font-medium'>Outside of coding, I love exploring new languages and diving into insightful books that inspire creativity. I'm always open to new opportunities and connections, so feel free to reach out!</p>
